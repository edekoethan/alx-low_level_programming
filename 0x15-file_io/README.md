In C, input and output (I/O) operations are used to interact with files, standard input (stdin), and standard output (stdout) streams.

Input operations are used to read data from files or the standard input stream. In C, the "scanf" function is used to read formatted data from standard input, while the "fscanf" function is used to read formatted data from a file. Both functions accept a format string and a set of pointers to the variables that will store the data that is read.

Output operations are used to write data to files or the standard output stream. In C, the "printf" function is used to write formatted output to the standard output stream, while the "fprintf" function is used to write formatted output to a file. Both functions accept a format string and a list of values to be written to the output stream or file.

In addition to these functions, C provides low-level I/O functions such as "open", "close", "read", and "write" that allow for direct manipulation of file descriptors. These functions are used to open and close files, read and write data to files, and manipulate file descriptors directly.

Overall, input and output operations in C are essential for working with files and streams, and understanding them is a fundamental part of writing programs in the C programming language
