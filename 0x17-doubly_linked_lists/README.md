A doubly linked list is a data structure in C that consists of nodes, where each node contains a data element and two pointers: one pointing to the previous node and another pointing to the next node. This allows for traversal in both forward and backward directions.

Here's a summary of the main operations and characteristics of a doubly linked list in C:

Node Structure:
c
Copy code
struct Node {
    int data;
    struct Node* prev;
    struct Node* next;
};
Initialization:
c
Copy code
struct Node* head = NULL;  // Initialize an empty list
Insertion:
Insertion at the beginning:
c
Copy code
struct Node* newNode = (struct Node*)malloc(sizeof(struct Node));
newNode->data = value;
newNode->prev = NULL;
newNode->next = head;

if (head != NULL)
    head->prev = newNode;

head = newNode;
Insertion at the end:
c
Copy code
struct Node* newNode = (struct Node*)malloc(sizeof(struct Node));
newNode->data = value;
newNode->next = NULL;

struct Node* current = head;
if (head == NULL) {
    newNode->prev = NULL;
    head = newNode;
    return;
}

while (current->next != NULL)
    current = current->next;

current->next = newNode;
newNode->prev = current;
Deletion:
Delete the first node:
c
Copy code
struct Node* temp = head;
head = head->next;
head->prev = NULL;
free(temp);
Delete the last node:
c
Copy code
struct Node* current = head;
while (current->next != NULL)
    current = current->next;

current->prev->next = NULL;
free(current);
Traversal:
Forward traversal:
c
Copy code
struct Node* current = head;
while (current != NULL) {
    // Process current node
    current = current->next;
}
Backward traversal:
c
Copy code
struct Node* current = head;
while (current->next != NULL)
    current = current->next;

while (current != NULL) {
    // Process current node
    current = current->prev;
}
These are the basic operations for a doubly linked list in C. Remember to handle memory allocation and deallocation appropriately.
