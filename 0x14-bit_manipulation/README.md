Bit manipulation in C involves performing operations on individual bits or groups of bits within a variable. This can be useful for tasks such as packing multiple values into a single variable, testing individual flags or settings, or performing bitwise arithmetic.

Here are some common bitwise operators used in C:

Bitwise AND (&): performs a bitwise AND operation between two values, resulting in a value where each bit is 1 only if both corresponding bits are 1.

Bitwise OR (|): performs a bitwise OR operation between two values, resulting in a value where each bit is 1 if either corresponding bit is 1.

Bitwise XOR (^): performs a bitwise XOR (exclusive OR) operation between two values, resulting in a value where each bit is 1 only if one corresponding bit is 1 and the other is 0.

Bitwise NOT (~): performs a bitwise NOT operation on a single value, resulting in a value where each bit is inverted (0s become 1s, and 1s become 0s).

Left shift (<<): shifts the bits of a value to the left by a specified number of positions. This effectively multiplies the value by 2 to the power of the shift amount.

Right shift (>>): shifts the bits of a value to the right by a specified number of positions. This effectively divides the value by 2 to the power of the shift amount.
